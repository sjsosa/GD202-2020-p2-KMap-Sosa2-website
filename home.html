    <h2>ABOUT THE SCIENCE MUSEUM</h2>
       
            <h3> mission </h3>
            <p class="ex1">The NC Museum of Natural Sciences is a center of research, collections, living collections, exhibitions and digital media, and lifelong education. They strive to use science for community engagement through all these aspects, and in turn, aim to diversify a portfolio of public earned and contributed funds. They are constantly analyzing their actions, outcomes, and data to see how they can be most relevant to evolving needs and opportunities of the public, locally and globally. The Museum’s stated mission and value is “to illuminate the natural world and inspire its conservation.”</p>

            <h3> funding </h3>
            <img src="elements/dollarsigns.png" width="20%" class="photogrid">
            <p class="ex2">The Museum’s operation depends on funding allocations from various North Carolina government departments, and many of their research positions are joint appointments with the University of North Carolina System. Overall, non-State sources consist of approximately 30% of the total annual funding.</p>

    <h2 class="lightblue">THE MUSEUM AS A SPACE</h2>
            
            <h3 class="lightblue">the lobby</h3>
            <p class="ex3">The first floor is a bit of an ‘in-between place’. Since the general public enters here, half of its purpose is an introduction to the museum, with two help desks in front. The other half of its purpose is to be a place of exploration. Beyond the help desk is an open area filled with glass cases that have specimens and replicas of flora and fauna. The glass cases are not arranged in a clear pattern, so people can wander freely with no pre-cut path. Kids touch the glass, and some school-aged children hold papers for a scavenger hunt.  Despite it being a great place for exploration, it does not engage people for a long period of time.</p>

            <img src="elements/chicken.png" width="35%" class="photogrid2">
            <p class="ex4">This exhibit is in a large room with a high ceiling. The room has a dome-like architectural design and walls that consist of long glass windows. The is filled with natural light and a feeling of spaciousness. There are two giant skeletons dinosaur skeletons that take up a good portion of the space. Pterodactyls circle up above and dinosaur sounds play in the background. All these elements come together to spur curiosity.</p>
