    <h1>UNDERSTANDING ACCESSIBILITY</h1>
    
    <h3>the price of a ticket</h3>
    
        <p class="ex1">Often times, when people talk about accessibility, they may first associate the term with physical or mental disabilities. Dawson talks about how the price of a ticket into a science center oftentimes is one of the key barriers to participation. The price of a ticket itself can exclude various communities and detracts from accessibility for a broad public. In order to truly be inclusive, making sure museums are accessible to people of various socioeconomic statuses is crucial to truly stepping towards equity in science education.</p>

    <h3>museum resources</h3>
    
        <p class="ex2">The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences has a ton of resources for the diverse crowds that it attracts. On their website, they have guides sharing available services, which include sign language interpreters, quiet rooms, assistive listening devices and more. They even have a sensory map for those with autism or sensory processing disorders. It shows sensory-friendly spaces in the museum and the quieter times of the day. Lastly, the cost to get into the museum is free, so it is truly open to all.</p>
