    <h1>DEMOGRAPHIC DATA</h1>
    
    <h3>various audiences</h3>
    
        <p class="ex1">Museum audiences are a heterogeneous group with many combinations of socio-demographic characteristics including but not limited to, age, ethnicity, educational level, gender, field of study, and professional background. They are also heterogeneous with goals, prior knowledge, and interests. By examining collected demographic data, one can create links between content of museum exhibitions and visitors, and learn how to tailor to various audiences.</p>

    <h3>age demographics</h3>
    
        <p class="ex2">Throughout the day, various audiences and publics visited the museum. On weekdays, there often are large groups of kids on field trips and parents with young children. There are a couple of elderly couples, and a few of families with older high school-aged kids too. On busy weekends, all sorts of audiences show up, but the large majority is elementary-aged kids with parents and grandparents. On special days, such as Astronomy Day, the museum is packed with almost every single age demographic, but there is still an overwhelming majority of younger kids with parents. One demographic that had low numbers is younger adults without children.</p>
