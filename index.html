        <h1>WHAT IS SCIENCE COMMUNICATION?</h1>

        <h3> Science communication means making science readily available, accessible, and understandable to the general public who may not have much of a scientific background.</h3>
        
    <div class="ex1">
        
        <h4> Public science communication comes from a variety of sources: science museums, science festivals, public lectures, social media use, and more.</h4>
            
        <h4>Since public communication activities play such a huge role in getting science to society today, it has quite an influence on the publicâ€™s approach to welfare, democracy, and culture.</h4>

        <h4> It is important to effectively communicate scientific knowledge in order to stimulate and further social welfare. Through effective science communication, we can make a more educated and engaged public.</h4>
            
        <h4>A public science museum is a perfect place to explore the concept of information itself being accessible.</h4>
