    <h1>LEARNING ACTIVITIES</h1>
    
    <h3>context of learning</h3>
    
        <p class="ex1">When communicating science, one must first consider the context that it is being shared in. Second, one must consider who is receiving that information. Hetland stresses the importance of addressing all the different publics with relevant information and modes of communication. The interaction between various population groups can help perpetuate the exchange of information to meet various learning levels and styles.</p>

    <h3>the museum's activities</h3>
    
        <p class="ex2">The museum has a variety of learning activities, starting with an extensive amount of exhibits. There are temporary exhibitions and permanent exhibitions, self-guided tours, and opportunities to explore science through digital media. In addition, the museum has a vast amount of live animals and living collections. The museum also hosts a number of special events, oftentimes dedicating whole days to a specific area of science such as astronomy. Certain activities such as Storytime is always geared towards toddlers and preschoolers. The rest of the activities are geared towards whoever the predominant age group is. The museum always tries to tailor activities so people can learn at different age levels.</p>
